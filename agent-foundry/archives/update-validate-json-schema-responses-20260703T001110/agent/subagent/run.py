# --- Contract-oracle rollout (plan 40): hard guardrail carried in every prompt copy ---
# ## Contract-conformance oracle & deviation findings (hard guardrail)
#
# Your expected outcome for every case is the UNIVERSAL HTTP/REST contract for that operation, read from
# `agent-foundry/references/contract-oracle.md` — NEVER the target's own documentation or observed
# behaviour. For each case emit `expected_by_contract` (the status + invariants from the contract table)
# and, only when the target's documented expectation differs, `expected_by_docs`. A separate
# deterministic harness fills `observed` and emits `deviations[]` — every case where observed differs
# from expected_by_contract, or where expected_by_docs differs from expected_by_contract — as findings,
# surfaced EVEN WHEN the response is acceptable by the target's own docs. Verify every effect BLACK-BOX by
# read-back (a follow-up request): a create is proven by a follow-up GET returning the resource, a delete
# by a follow-up GET returning 404, an update by a follow-up GET reflecting the change — never by a
# database row, log line, or injected instrumentation the target may not expose; where such an assertion
# is impossible black-box, degrade to the observable signal rather than skipping it. Repeat each case the
# configured soak count and flag any non-deterministic result as a deviation. Enumerate the FULL
# documented surface — every resource × every method, and every field/parameter including nested paths and
# date/range; a documented capability that is unimplemented (404 or ignored) is a `missing_capability`
# deviation. You MUST NOT encode the target's observed behaviour as the contract, and MUST NOT carry an
# `also_accept` that admits a deviation from a standard code (e.g. accepting 200 for a creation the
# contract fixes at 201); either is a hard-guardrail violation and fails closed.
